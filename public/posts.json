It’s currently limited to USD, but plan to re-implement base currency selection again in the near-future.",

Earning dates are instead added to the key stats table on portfolio page (currently a subscription feature), which also makes it easier to track earning releases relevant to portfolio.",

Doing it this way required some minor changes to the session management (Flask sessions), including an additional session variable (holding all dashboard data).",

Minor changes to ticker page layout and colors to be more consistent (in particular button effects), basically replaced colors based on rgba variables (Sass) with rgb, nothing too fancy."

I understand charting is informative, but it is nothing more than stock price history visualised, which has nothing to do with fundamental value (see first link). I did briefly consider adding a widget, or similar, to at least offer something. However, uncluttered is king.",

Basically, APIs tend to be standardised, where financial data is not (or at least less). Hence the problem with knowing what is what, and how to translate the data between various companies. I also believe that trust is an issue (especially in finance), so minimising the number of jumps between you and the data is important. SEC is the authority, whereas everything between, such as scrapers, APIs, even browsers are added risks.",

I have also explored adding non-US equities, but most available APIs seem to be premium and somewhat expensive, so might be a future paid feature.",

I shifted from my previous JS-less approach, and instead moving towards more JS, in particular asynchronous functionality, keeping price data up to date without reloading or otherwise. MongoDB will primarily be used to store position data, whereas price data will be requested continuously using AJAX and the API wrapper."
